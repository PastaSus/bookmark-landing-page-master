## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- ARIA(accessibility)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- Vite
- Vercel
- Axe Dev Tools

### What I learned

Css have come so far that we can do alot of things with it without relying on js really its really amazing.
I also got used to tailwind throughout this whole challenge

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<details class="group border-b border-b-[var(--Grey-50)] py-4">
  <summary
    class="flex cursor-pointer items-center justify-between lg:hover:text-[var(--Red-400)]"
  >
    <span class="">What about other Chromium browsers?</span>
    <svg
      class="transition-transform duration-300 group-open:rotate-180 group-open:stroke-[var(--Red-400)]"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      width="18"
      height="12"
      viewBox="0 0 18 12"
      fill="none"
      stroke="#5267DF"
      aria-hidden="true"
      focusable="false"
    >
      <path d="M1 1l8 8 8-8" stroke-width="3" />
    </svg>
  </summary>
  <p class="mt-5 mb-3 text-gray-400">
    Integer condimentum ipsum id imperdiet finibus. Vivamus in placerat mi, at
    euismod dui. Aliquam vitae neque eget nisl gravida pellentesque non ut
    velit.
  </p>
</details>
```

Only used css on the code above no js for animating the arrow

### Continued development

Use react.js with tailwind in the future

### Useful resources
